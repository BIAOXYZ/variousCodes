王家卫谈《一代宗师》：有太多价值都已失落 https://cn.nytimes.com/film-tv/20140115/t15wong/ || https://cn.nytimes.com/film-tv/20140115/t15wong/dual/
- > 《一代宗师》片名所指的人物是由梁朝伟(Tony Leung)饰演的叶问(Ip Man)，他在武术圈里很受尊崇，因为李小龙(Bruce Lee)就师承叶问。但今年55岁的王家卫说，他心中的目标比简简单单讲述叶问的人生故事更为宏大：他还希望通过《一代宗师》，对他在当代中国文化中见到的崇尚物质的不健康趋势发表评论。 <br> The title character in “The Grandmaster,” played by Tony Leung, is Ip Man, revered in martial arts circles as the teacher of Bruce Lee. But Mr. Wong, 55, said he had a purpose in mind larger than simply telling part of Ip Man’s life story: he also wanted to use “The Grandmaster” to comment on what he sees as unhealthy materialistic trends in contemporary Chinese culture.
- > 答：在华语电影中，功夫片是最受欢迎的类型，远比其他类型要受欢迎，但我感觉有一些方面没有得到妥善的处理。这些电影多数都在展示动作，但是在这部片子里我们想要强调的是荣誉和传承的规范。中国武术大师会把自己当成园丁，料理自己的园子是一份荣誉，要把园子耕耘得更好，交给子孙后代。我想，在当下这个个人成就似乎是成功的唯一标准的时代，这是一则十分重要的忠告。 <br> A. In Chinese cinema, the kung fu film is by far the most popular form, but I feel there are certain things that haven’t been addressed properly. Most of these films show the action. But in this film we wanted to highlight  the code of honor and legacy. Chinese martial artists consider themselves to be gardeners, and it’s an honor for them to take care of this garden, to better it and hand it over to the generations that follow. I think that’s a very important message in a time when personal achievement seems to be the only criteria of success.
- > 答：如果你看叶问一生的故事，就会发现很有悲剧性，因为他出身富贵，他接受训练并不是为了成为武术大师。但他经历了那么多磨难，时运不济，最后孤身一人来到香港，当时十分穷困。而唯一引导他的是，他一直坚持自己的原则，坚持中国武术的规范。这很让人感动。 <br> A. When you look at the life story of Ip Man, it’s very tragic, because he was born with a silver spoon and was not trained to be a martial artist. But he went through so many difficulties, the times were against him, and he ended up in Hong Kong alone, and he was very poor at that time. The only thing that guided him is that he stuck to his principles, to the code of the Chinese martial artist. That is  very moving.
